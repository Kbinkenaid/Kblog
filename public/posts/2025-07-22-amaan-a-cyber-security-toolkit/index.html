The target was to locally host several cybersecurity tools in a single hub. Making everything Open Sourced, and Free to Use, it was not the easiest but I got there in the end.
What It Actually Does

<h2 id="what-it-actually-does">What It Actually Does</h2>
<p>Project Amaan is a web-based cybersecurity toolkit that puts the essential tools you need in one clean interface. No more command-line gymnastics for basic tasks.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-bits-for-the-curious">The Technical Bits (For the Curious)</h2>
<p>Built with React and TypeScript because I like my code to not break when I look at it sideways. Vite for building because life&rsquo;s too short for slow build tools. Tailwind for styling because utility classes just make sense.</p>
<p>The UI switches between dark and light themes because apparently that&rsquo;s important to people (dark mode gang, where you at?).</p>
<h2 id="security-stuff-obviously">Security Stuff (Obviously)</h2>
<p>No sensitive data gets stored. API keys go in environment variables like civilized human beings. Built-in CORS protection and input validation because we&rsquo;re not animals.</p>
<p>The whole thing&rsquo;s stateless - spin up a container, use it, tear it down. Clean.</p>
<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>
<p>Look, this isn&rsquo;t going to replace your entire toolkit. It&rsquo;s not meant to. It&rsquo;s for when you need quick answers without the overhead. When you&rsquo;re in a meeting and someone asks &ldquo;hey, has our domain been in any breaches?&rdquo; and you can have an answer in thirty seconds instead of five minutes.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got ideas. More encoding formats, additional network tools, maybe some basic vulnerability scanning. But the core principle stays the same: useful tools, clean interface, minimal friction. There is an idea to adapt more to be used for up and coming CTF&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing security research, pen testing, or just curious about this stuff, give it a spin. It&rsquo;s open source, so if something&rsquo;s missing or broken, you know what to do.</p>
